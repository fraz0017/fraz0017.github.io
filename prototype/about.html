        <div class="parent2">
            <div class="para para1">
                <h1>What Exactly is Vault-Tec?</h1>
                <p>Vault-Tec is a company who was contacted by your loving government to design and produce the vault system, a vast network of fallout and research shelters. This network expands over 100 vaults across America, 122 to be exact!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="para para2">
                <h1>Why Vault-Tec?</h1>
                <p>We want you to be something greater than a victim of nuclear war! A number of our vaults are planned to preserve the greatest and brightest of our society. If you fear that you do not fall into either of those categories, do not fret! We have plenty of vaults made specifically for you to make you the most special version of yourself you can be and do just as much good for us as anyone else!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="para para3">
                <h1>So, what are these special vaults you mentioned?</h1>
                <p>Vault-Tec wants to preserve the best of our society. For instance, Vault 111, located in Boston’s Commonwealth, will truly preserve a number of our strongest soldiers who fought to keep this country safe for as long as possible until the inevitable apocalypse that will destroy our great nation anyways. We also intend that our vault 92 in Washington DC will preserve the country’s musical talent! Equipped with state-of-the-art, Vault-Tec exclusive sound systems!</p>

                <h1>Can I Research or Visit my Vault-Tec Vault Before Making my Decision?</h1>
                <p>Vault-Tec does not and will not allow any kind of tour of any of our facilities. Vault-Tec also reserves the right to keep all information of our vaults undisclosed to our future residents before and after they enter their vault. We do, however, have a small mock-up of a standard vault that is open for touring at the Museum of Technology in the downtown area of Washington DC. Fun for the whole family!</p>

            <div class="para para9">
                <h1>In that Case, Where can I Sign Up?</h1>
                <p>Start by contacting your Vault-Tec Representative today! This, of course, is only an option for those who were specifically reached out to by Vault-Tec for reasons such as overwhelming talent or skills, and those whose children attend Malden Middle School in Boston’s Commonwealth. To those who were not pre-selected by Vault-Tec, know that we still want you! We invite you to our Vault-Tec: Among the Stars exhibit in Boston’s Nuka World, where you can purchase a spot in one of our vaults and join our Vault-Tec family! </p>
