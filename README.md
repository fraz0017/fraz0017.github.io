Bootstrap was definitely a huge part in the making of my web portfolio. I loved its mobile-first approach and it is something I plan to continue implementing in the future. My biggest challenge was my own minor imcompetance. I somehow designed an entire site to look good only at 60% zoom, and had to adjust my code accordingly to fix my sizing issues. The main lesson I learned from that experience was that I will always check the browser's zoom (as well as sue the creator of live server for zooming in my browser without some indication). After that little hiccup, the design was smooth sailing.I learned a lot more about how Bootstrap works and how to make it work with my css. 

Bootstrap was used in the making of this site, and two google fonts were also used.
